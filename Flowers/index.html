    <h1>About the Game</h1>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>
        This gameâ€™s goal is to bring peace to the player. This is a game made for my class ArtG 139 at UC Santa Cruz.
      </p>

    <h2><i>The assignment was as follows:</i></h2>
      <p>
      - Make an Analog or Digital game that makes the player feel a certain emotion.
        The emotion was determined by a set of cards. These cards were distributed
        by the professor to the group/person. How we decided to invoke the feeling was up to us.<br>
      - I decided to go the digital route
      </p>
